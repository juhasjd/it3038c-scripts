## Documentaion

I initially wanted to create this project because it ties into what I'm going to do for my senior capstone project next fall. My capstone project is going to be about a applicaiton that tests the password stregth for users in a company. This ties into that because this would be a way to make a new password if a users password tests as weak. I also think that this is useful because, lets be honest, we all use the same 3-5 passwords for everything. That being said, this could help you change that.
